Parts
=====
Laser diode ADL-65055TL

Design requirements
===================
Supply voltage Vdd 3v3
Supply current <10mA
Input current 0-400uA (From PD-LD datasheet)
Output 100mv-3.2v (100 mv less that Vdd). The TIA output should never settle at Vdd or GND.

Design goals
=============
Gain(v/A) =========>(3.2/0.0004)=8kv/A
Vout for 0uA ======>0v
Vout for 400uA ====> 3.2V
-3dB bandwidth ====>200kHz(So that the sampling and signal processing subsystem can sample at >= 10x -3dB bandwidth)
Phase margin:  ====>45deg

Design procedure
================

The TIA output voltage needs to settle at (Vout for 0uA) when the PD has no output current(0uA). This is due to the lack of a dual supply rail.

PD is reverse biased at Vr=0 and this ensures that the effects of dark current when illuminance=0 is minimised.

vout=Ipd.R1+Vdd.(R3/R3+R2)

Missing information: PD junction capacitance at various voltages. We shall thus test for operation over a capacitance pF range that make sense.


Gain resistor calculation
=========================
Vout(Range) = Ipd(Range).R1 therefore R1 = Vout(Range)/Ipd(Range).

R1=3.2-0.1=3.1/(0.0004)=7.75kohm~7.87kohm(E96)

Feedback capacitor calculation
==============================

The feedback resistor and capacitor will have a break frequency given by:

Fbreak=(1/2*pi*C*R)

C(ideal)=1.02680608446e-10 F <= 0.1pF therefore = 0.1nF = 100pF

Amplifier gain bandwidth calculation
====================================
Taking Cj+Cd+Ccm2=40pF . I have taken the Cj geuss as quite high due to the small package area the Monitor photodiode has to contend with.
Thus capacitance will be greater between the anode and cathode.

fGBW=287505.70365=287.505kHz

Bias network
============
R2=21.25kohm~21kohm(E96) R1=680kohm

Decoupling capacitor placed in parallel is used to provide a path for power supply noise from reaching the amplifier system.

A capacitor of 10nF was chosen that would have a break frequency of 781Hz thus would have a relatively low impedance for the first 15 harmonics at the power line 50Hz frequency to ground.

*** It would also be good to place a low value cap with good dielectric in parallel to this to prevent high frequencies also passing to the system. Probably. Be careful to avoid ground loops at DC.

The value of this high frequency decoupling capacitors is 33pF NPO at 2.4GHz, 1000pF/ 1nF at 100MHz.

Opamp selection criteria from the design
========================================
Max supply voltage(>3v3)
Min supply voltage(<3v3)
Quiescent current(<10mA)
Input voltage range(N/A)
Output voltage range(0.1-3.2)
GBW: >450kHz

Opamp selected(TLV2760 from Mouser electronics)(SOIC-8)
====================================================
Max supply voltage(3.6v)
Min supply voltage(1.8v)
Shutdown: Yes
Quiescent current(20uA)
Input voltage range(N/A)
Output voltage range(rail to rail)
GBW: 500kHz
Input offset voltage:(3.5mv)
Input bias current: 15pA
Slew rate: 0.23v/us
Input voltage noise density: 95nv/sqrt(Hz)
Input noise current density: 0.0008pA/sqrt(Hz)


Therefore now calculating the resulting GBW with values of differential and common mode capacitance as 2pF each, the required GBW is lowered
thus we are thus in the clear.

Calculate full power bandwidth
==============================
This affects the amplifier output swing. The maximum frequency that can be achieved for a full swing is:

(Slewrate)/2*pi*amplitude swing= 23616.5399427 Hz therefore for fullscale output signals, any frequency beyond this will be distorted. This should be safe as the sound frequencies exist till 24kHz.

Stability analysis:
===================
At the loop closure point:
@6pF junction capacitance - 604.75kHz @ 0dB, phase margin is 77.15 deg
@53pF junction capacitance - 442.7kkHz @ 0dB, phase margin is 73.41 deg
@100pF junction capacitance - 357.17kHz @ 0dB, phase margin is 69.37 deg
